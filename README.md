# T20-Predictor-Analysis
Preprocessed and augmented the dataset to improve model accuracy to 93.4%, trained the model,  created API using model and Python, and used front end.  
The T20 predictor successfully demonstrates the potential of machine learning 
This repository contains the code for an end-to-end T20 World Cup prediction system implemented in Python. 
The project utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and XGBoost for data manipulation, cleaning, and building predictive models. 
Additionally, the prediction system is deployed using Streamlit for easy access and interaction.
